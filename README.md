# Hardware-Acceleration-of-RTL-Constraints-Solver

-------------- Input example should be a text file named "input.txt" -------------------------
constraints on input format
- must be more than one constraint
- and constraints only
- integral variables only
- input is in the form "y0 , y1, ..." with the same order should start with y0
- if we want a negative coeff it should be - 1 not -1 for the coeff of a variable
- for a number it should be -1 not -1
<h3>Ex:</h3>
<div>
2 <br>
1 y0 + 1 y1 <= 10
and
1 y0 <= 10
and
1 y1 <= 10
         </div>
